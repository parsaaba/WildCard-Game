This is a NFT GAME based on blackjack multiplayer, First I try to use Unity and photon but I didn't like it so I switched to Godot with nakama multiplayer. (Godot version 3.4 only && Login via Metamask)

You can battle other players with Card NFTs with different abilities.

# How does my multiplayer work
Imagine me and my friend playing chess in different rooms. When I moved my checkers from d2 to d3, I told my friend to move the checkers from d2 to d3, and if my friend moved d7 to d6.
My friend will tell me again.
